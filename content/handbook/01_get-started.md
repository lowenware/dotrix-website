Welcome to Dotrix Handbook! The goal of this document is to
centralize the engine documentation at one place and provide
usefull tips and recommendations about how the engine is supposed
to be used.

## What is Dotrix

Dotrix is a 3D engine with focus on GPU-driven rendering written in
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language. Dotrix is
being distributed as a set of native Rust packages, called crates
and available on both [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/dotrix)
and [GitHub](https://github.com/lowenware/dotrix/).

## API Reference

As any published Rust crate, Dotrix has public
[API Reference](https://docs.rs/dotrix) that is very useful for
developers.

## How to use the Handbook

It is highly recommended to go throw the **Get Started** sections
one by one to get the complete understanding of Dotrix architecture,
while other chapters can be read in any order on demand as soon as
they cover specific aspects of the engine.

Dotrix team wishes you pleasant reading and success in development!
