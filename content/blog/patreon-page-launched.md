If you like our 3D engine project, there is more than
[GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/lowenware) to support us!

This summer our company celebrated its 5 years anniversary and to
the date we launched a Patreon page for Dotrix, the project we
invest our souls in. 

We devote the most part of our free time to Dotrix. With the support
from our patrons we will put more of our work resources in its
development. Our goal is a full-time engagement. For the patrons our
team prepared benefits. Depending on the level you will get access
to our developers Discord channel, name in the list of the project
supporters and DotrixBooks â€“ special edition notepads lined with
dots! 

For more information we invite you to visit our
[Patreon page](https://patreon.com/lowenware)!
